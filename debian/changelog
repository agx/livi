  * Update copyright.
    The files this is based on are LGPL 2.1 in GTK so keep it like that.
  * ci: Use Debian trixie
  * build: Require gtk 4.12
  * sink: Avoid deprecated gdk_gl_texture_new.
    See GTK commit fa44d258d090cc44bb3fc6f21b4d9f32212ae2b8
  * paintable: Avoid -Wfloat-equal compiler warning.
    Use G_APPROX_VALUE
  * paintable: Move interface definition to the top.
    As we do it in phosh, etc
  * paintable: Use automatic cleanup for context
  * sink: Use automatic cleanup for the buffer pool
  * sink: Use automatic cleanup for texture
  * sink: Use automatic cleanup for tmp caps
  * window: Add visual feedback when skipping ff/rev/play/pause.
    Show a centered icon indicating what's going on.
  * window: Drop unused variables
  * window: Indiate end of stream
  * window: Track warnings.
    Let's make sure we at least print them to the console
  * window: Show overlay icon on slider value changes
  * main: Don't hardcode window height in two locations.
    We have it in the ui file too
  * window: Use a larger default height.
    Otherwise we cut off parts of the page
  * window: Drop some unused variables
  * url-processor: New class to fetch URLs via yt-dlp
  * main: Add --yt-dlp command line option.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/livi/-/issues/6
  * window: Bubble up url-processor error messages
  * window: Use livi_window_set_error internally too
  * main: Allow F11 as fullscreen shortcut
  * metainfo: Remove .desktop from app-id.
    As per https://freedesktop.org/software/appstream it's not part
    of the app-id.
  * window: Use same margin for info overlay than for controls
  * window: Use AdwApplicationWindow
  * build: Bump Adwaita dependency to 1.4.
    We want to use AdwHeaderBar
  * window: Make top bar transparent. Gets us closer to the designs
